Introduction :
In the current global scenario, environmental sustainability has become a critical concern. One 
significant factor contributing to environmental degradation is consumer purchasing habits, 
which often prioritize convenience over eco-friendliness. This has led to increased waste and 
exploitation of natural resources. There is a pressing need for tools that can educate and guide 
consumers towards more sustainable purchasing decisions

Assistant that assists users in making sustainable purchasing decisions. The chatbot will 
provide:

2. Tips for relieving from stress.  
3. Suggesting various types of exercise.  
4. Provides information about nutritious food.
